  * when parens in assign lhs, treat unary* and single arg like no parens
  * VarNode#ident is now kept in a slot, not an ivar
  * force body of a block to always be a SequenceNode
  * added RedParse::Nodes; include it to get all the redparse node classes
  * have each node class remember a list of its slot names
  * added aliases and accessors in various nodes to make the api nicer
  * moved some utilities into the support libraries where they belong

  * minor tweaks to #unparse
  * value of () is nil, not false
  * get redparse/version.rb relative to current directory from gemspec
  * when comparing trees, more insignificant differences are ignored
  * Node#deep_copy makes more faithful copies now
  * node marshalling should be more reliable
  * tweaks to parse_tree support to improve conformance
  * support automagicness of integer&regexp in flipflop (in parse_tree output)
  * parse_tree's placement of :begin nodes is somewhat better emulated
  * always put parse inputs into binary mode
  * changed some operators (lhs, rescue3 unary* rhs*) to proper precedence
  * numeric literals inserted directly in parsetrees should be autoquoted
  * ensure @lhs_parens set in AssignNode when it should be
  * make sure ListInNode is extended into arrays added to Nodes via writers
  * permit empty symbol LiteralNode to be made

* 9 Changes To Tests:
  * test Node trees surviving Marshal/Ron round-trip and deep_copy unscathed
  * tests for many of the new 1.9 syntax constructions
  * parse_tree server process now started in a more portable way
  * lots of new test cases
  * rp-locatetest now has docs on how to use it
  * keep track of problematic files if even the slightest problem occurs
  * enable/disable fuzzing with ENV var rather than comments
  * make sure inputs are unchanged by parse
  * better organized some of the known failing testcases

=== 0.8.3 / 1jul2009
* 7 Minor Enhancements:
  * most nodes now have startline, endline, and offset
  * Node.[] is more fun to use now (most attributes can be left off)
  * a SequenceNode inserted into a SequenceNode now gets inlined
  * new ListInNode module for the various vanilla arrays found in node trees
  * HashLiteralNode#get; retrieve values from hash literal kinda like from a hash
  * Nodes can be catenated with the + operator now
  * Symbols inserted into a tree are converted to CallSiteNodes

* 2 Bugfixes:
  * more faithful ParseTree emulation in a couple of cases
  * minor fixes in node processing for some rare conditions 

=== 0.8.2 / 21apr2009
* 14 Minor Enhancements:
  * should be no tokens left in Node tree now
  * lots of code trying to make things faster (no luck so far)
  * declare types and parameters of variation of all inputs
  * to_parsetree now outputs 1.8.6 (new default) as well as 1.8.7 tree formats
  * #parsetree takes a session arg instead of thread-local variables
  * reduce number of warnings/noise in test output
  * created #to_parsetree_and_warnings: returns warnings along with a tree
  * (for now, no warnings are ever emitted, tho)
  * some utilities for working with node trees
  * split off rescue operator and begin..end from ParenedNode
  * made a VarNode to replace VarNameToken in node trees
  * Reg::Repeat#subregs was missing, had to hack one up
  * Reg::LookBack/LookAhead#subregs were missing too
  * unparse now tracks lines in the original src
  * beginnings of support for 1.9 syntax

* 10 Bugfixes:
  * don't panic if rubygems not available
  * @lvalue is not useful to clients, so ignore it when comparing trees
  * many improvements to unparser; most expressions now unparse correctly
  * rescue and friends now work in modules, classes and metaclasses
  * word array splitter is perfect now
  * comma and unary star now have right precedence wrt = in all cases
  * fixed miscellaneous minor misparsings
  * some of the remaining ParseTree compatibility bugs removed
  * string contents are now always left unaltered in Node tree output
  * (so escape translation has to be done later, when Nodes are used)
  * #to_parsetree of an empty source text should be happier now

=== 0.8.1 / 21apr2009
* 4 Minor Enhancements:
  * fixed embarassing permissions problems
