=== 0.8.3 / 2009-07-01

  * Node.[] is more fun to use now (most attributes can be left off)
  * a SequenceNode inserted into a SequenceNode now gets inlined
  * new ListInNode module for the various vanilla arrays found in node trees
  * HashLiteralNode#get; retrieve values from hash literal kinda like from a hash
  * Nodes can be catenated with the + operator now
  * Symbols inserted into a tree are converted to CallSiteNodes

* 2 Bugfixes:

=== 0.8.2 / 2009-04-21
* 14 Minor Enhancements:
  * should be no tokens left in Node tree now
  * lots of code trying to make things faster (no luck so far)
  * declare types and parameters of variation of all inputs
  * to_parsetree now outputs 1.8.6 (new default) as well as 1.8.7 tree formats
  * #parsetree takes a session arg instead of thread-local variables
  * reduce number of warnings/noise in test output
  * created #to_parsetree_and_warnings: returns warnings along with a tree
  * (for now, no warnings are ever emitted, tho)
  * some utilities for working with node trees
  * split off rescue operator and begin..end from ParenedNode
  * made a VarNode to replace VarNameToken in node trees
  * Reg::Repeat#subregs was missing, had to hack one up
  * Reg::LookBack/LookAhead#subregs were missing too
  * unparse now tracks lines in the original src
  * beginnings of support for 1.9 syntax

* 10 Bugfixes:
  * don't panic if rubygems not available
  * @lvalue is not useful to clients, so ignore it when comparing trees
  * many improvements to unparser; most expressions now unparse correctly
  * rescue and friends now work in modules, classes and metaclasses
  * word array splitter is perfect now
  * comma and unary star now have right precedence wrt = in all cases
  * fixed miscellaneous minor misparsings
  * some of the remaining ParseTree compatibility bugs removed
  * string contents are now always left unaltered in Node tree output
  * (so escape translation has to be done later, when Nodes are used)
  * #to_parsetree of an empty source text should be happier now
